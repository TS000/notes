 <h3>Enterprise System Weaknesses</h3>
 <p>I talked with a gentleman who worked for HP for 45 years, I gleaned the following from our conversation</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Amazon is capable of switching out a part of their system which might get infected within a 30 second window.</li>
       <li>Google uses the cheapest Chinese tech and when it breaks they just buy new stuff.</li>
       <li>HP pretty much just has a red light which goes off if something gets compromised. So if you can spoof their alert system you can play for as long as you want.</li>
    </ul>
